- **`BuildCategory`** - Enum for organizing builds into categories
- **`MaterialType`** - Enum with material options and block mappings
- **`BuildSize`** - Enum for size scaling options
- **`BuildStyle`** - Enum for architectural style variations
- **`BuildConfig`** - Configuration container for build parameters
- **`BuildInfo`** - Information about block requirements and estimates

#### Entry Points

- **`BuilderUIMod`** - Server-side mod initialization
- **`BuilderUIModClient`** - Client-side initialization and keybinding

### Design Principles

- **Modular Design** - Each build type is self-contained
- **Extensibility** - Easy to add new structures, materials, or styles
- **Player-Friendly** - Intuitive UI with clear information
- **Performance** - Efficient block placement with state tracking
- **Compatibility** - Works with vanilla Minecraft blocks

## Technical Details

### Build System

Each structure implements:
1. **Origin Calculation** - Based on player position and offsets
2. **State Recording** - Saves original blocks for undo
3. **Block Placement** - Constructs structure with configured materials
4. **Undo Registration** - Records action in undo history

### Material System

Materials use a three-tier system:
- **Primary Block** - Main building material
- **Secondary Block** - Supporting structures (floors, roofs)
- **Decorative Block** - Accents and details

### Undo System

- Maintains per-player undo history
- Stores original BlockState for each modified position
- Limits history to prevent memory issues (10 actions)
- Restores blocks in a single operation

### Custom Structure Storage

Structures are saved as JSON files:
```
builderui_structures/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_custom_house.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ awesome_tower.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ epic_castle.json
```
